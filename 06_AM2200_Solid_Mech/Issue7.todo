State of Stress Calculator for Prismatic Bodies and Beams
=========================================================

Description
-----------
Develop a calculator for the state of stress in prismatic bodies and beams subjected to axial, torsional, shear, and bending loads as functions of x, y, z.

Scope
-----
Supported Loading Types:
- Axial load
- Torsional load --- Only for cylinder
- Shear load
- Bending load

Inputs:
- Geometry and cross-sectional properties (A, I, J)
- Material properties (E, G, Poisson's ratio)
- External loads and boundary conditions

Outputs:
- Stress components at user-defined points
- Principal stresses and maximum shear stress
- (Optional) Safety factor if allowable/yield stress is provided

Implementation
--------------
- Language: Python
- Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, SymPy
- Approach: Start with closed-form solutions; API must support extensibility.
